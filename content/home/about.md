# Biography

Margaret Petroff is an associated professor in the Reproductive and Developmental Sciences Program at Michigan State University.  Dr. Petroff’s laboratory addresses two main, interrelated questions in the areas of reproductive immunology.  The first relates to the immunological paradox of pregnancy: the survival of the semiallogeneic fetus in an immunologically foreign environment – the mother.
